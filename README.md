# DiseaseMachineLearning
A compilation of a few disease prediction models created using Machine Learning

I am following the general rule of thumb whereby I am using 20% Test Data, 80% Training Data for the Model Training & Testing/Evaluation

Diabetes Prediction System makes use of Support Vector Machine Classifier algorithm
Heart Disease Prediction System makes use of Logistic Regression algorithm
Breast Cancer Prediction System makes use of Logistic Regression algorithm

The 3 projects can be run via their main.py file
